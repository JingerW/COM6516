/*
* HelloWorld.java
* A traditional Hello World program!
*/

// In Java, all programs reside in a class. This class is called HelloWorld, 
// and should be saved in a file called HelloWorld.java. This class has a single
// method called main, which is the entry point to the program.
//
// Compiling the class with javac HelloWorld.java will produce a bytecode file
// called HelloWorld.class if compilation is successful. This bytecode can then
// be run on any machine with a java bytecode interpreter. You can run the
// bytecode in a console by typing java HelloWorld.

public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main( String[] arg ){

		String helloString = "Hello";
		String worldString = "World!";

		// In Java the System.out.println command displays the argument to the 
		// console. However the command below doesn't work, because helloWorldAString
        // has not been declared. Try compiling this file to see what happens, 
        // and take a careful look at the error message that is produced.

		System.out.println( helloWorldString );

		// In Java, we can use the '+' operator to concatenate strings, 
		// so to fix this problem, either change the argument passed to the
		// System.out.println method from (helloWorldString) to 
		// (helloString + " " + worldString)
		// or declare the variable helloWorldString before it is used by 
		// System.out.println by inserting 
		// String helloWorldString = helloString + " " + worldString;
		
		// In Java a variable can be declared anywhere in the code, so it is
		// possible to declare a variable just before it is used, which makes for
		// code that is easier to read and understand.
		
		// It is conventional to use mixed case for variable names and method 
		// names in Java, with with the first letter lower case, and then the 
		// first letter of each internal word in upper case -- e.g. helloString.
		// Class names start with a capital letter -- e.g. HelloWorld.java
